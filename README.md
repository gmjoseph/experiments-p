a grab bag of experiments that don't neatly fit into the other `*-experiments` repos

note that some of these might be partially implemented, buggy, not working, etc.

## math

math-related experiments, e.g.:

* gradient descent example
* linear least squares
* shape optimization
* systems of linear equations solvers
* verlet integration
* voronoi diagram

## spatial

spatial-oriented experiments, e.g.:

* point in polygon
* 2d ray tracing
* spatial data structures
